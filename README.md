#Title: Sales-Analysis of E-Commerce Website

Problem Statement with analysis

1. Sales Performance:
- November shows peak sales; investigate factors contributing to this and explore strategies to replicate success in other months, especially February which has the lowest sales.
- Focus on Technology category, as it has the highest sales. Consider expanding offerings or promotional activities within this category.
- Phones are a top performer; consider bundling or cross-selling to increase sales.  Conversely, address the underperformance of Fasteners.  Determine if pricing, marketing, or product availability is a factor.

2. Profitability:
- December shows peak profit; analyze December sales to understand why profit is higher in this month compared to November (which has higher sales).
- Technology category also leads in profit. Maintain focus and further analyze sub-categories within Technology for additional opportunities.
- Copiers are highly profitable, consider strategies to increase sales of this product. Investigate why Tables are underperforming in terms of profit.
- Address the low profitability of Tables â€“ review pricing, production costs, and marketing efforts.

3. Customer Segmentation:
- Consumer segment is crucial due to its highest sales and profit. Prioritize customer retention and satisfaction in this segment.
- Although the Consumer segment has the highest Sales-to-Profit ratio, analyze if this ratio is optimal. Consider if margins could be improved without significantly impacting sales volume. Explore opportunities to increase profitability in Home Office and Corporate segments.

4. General Recommendations:
- Analyze the correlation between sales and profit across various categories and sub-categories. This will help identify areas where increased sales translate to higher profits and where profit margins may need adjustments.
- Conduct a deeper dive into shipping costs, discounts, and other operational expenses for each category and segment to pinpoint areas for cost optimization.
- Periodically review product assortment based on sales and profit trends. Eliminate slow-moving, low-profit items and introduce new products aligned with market demand and profitability goals.
- Investigate customer demographics and preferences for each segment to tailor marketing campaigns and product offerings.
- Monitor sales and profit trends over time to identify emerging patterns and make proactive adjustments to strategies.
